This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Installing the Dependencies

Current project is tested and developed on Node v16+, using NPM. To prevent any complication when running this project, please make sure that when you install the project, you are already using Node v16+ 

You will require a copy of `.npmrc` in the project root directory to `npm install keysmith`. Please contact @Ailin for the credentials.

To install all required dependencies, either do `npm i` or `npm install`.

## Setting Up Development Environment

Create a copy of `.env.local.sample` in the project root directory and rename it to `.env.local`. 

Populate each of the variables with the credentials. Contact @Daud if you need help setting this up.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
